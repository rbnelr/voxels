GPU mesh tesselation (add more terrain detail on gpu)
 requires the worldgen code to also exist on the gpu, or for the gpu to have access to a finer voxel grid
 this is going to be complicated, since it needs to know about terrain edits too

Add terrain edit deltas for lag-free 1-frame terrain edits
 update some voxels and generate the mesh for them and then delete the triangles in the original mesh by setting their vertex indices to 0 (degenerate triangles)
 Does this cause even more seam complications? (man..., marching cubes seems appealing now)

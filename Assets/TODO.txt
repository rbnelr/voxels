Player Movement (Walking, Jumping)

Better worldgen:
 add numeric gradient calc and see if there are any disadvantages to it
 figure out techniques to do:
  non "circular" caves, ie. ground closer to ceiling
  flat planes (like lakes) in cave

 add feature that regenerates the world on worldgen parameter changes

Material Transitions (in Shader)

GPU mesh tesselation (add more terrain detail on gpu)
 requires the worldgen code to also exist on the gpu, or for the gpu to have access to a finer voxel grid
 this is going to be complicated, since it needs to know about terrain edits too

Add terrain edit deltas for lag-free 1-frame terrain edits
 update some voxels and generate the mesh for them and then delete the triangles in the original mesh by setting their vertex indices to 0 (degenerate triangles)
 Does this cause even more seam complications? (man..., marching cubes seems appealing now)

Reimplement LOD

Voxel based lighting (mainly GI (raycasting?))
